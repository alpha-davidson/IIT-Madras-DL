    "We will use a dense neural network in `torch` to solve a simple regression problem using physics data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Task\n",
    "We will construct a dense neural network to predict the invariant mass of a particle from its energy, momentum, (and charge).\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note that this task does not require machine learning. We choose a task with a known mapping to help us create, debug, and tune our first neural network.*\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset\n",
    "This dataset is a collection of simulated particle events from [Pythia](https://pythia.org/). The dataset is a 2D array where each row represents one event from an $e^{-} + p$ collision. This dataset is comprised _only_ of events where exactly 16 particles are produced from an electron-proton collision. Each particle contains $(p_x,p_y,p_z,E,q)$ information. Each event is therefore represented by 80 numbers.\n",
    "\n",

    "## Computational Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "If this is your first time in a Jupyter-like environment, please read the following carefully:\n",
    "\n",
    " - You are in an active kernel\n",
    " - Run each cell with `Shift + Enter`\n",
    " - You must execute the cells in the order that you want the code to run\n",
    " - `Runtime`$\\rightarrow$`Change runtime type` allows you to utilize GPUs and TPUs. They are unnecessary here, but will become vital in later exercises.\n"

    "1. Would scaling your data help your model?\n",
    "2. Might including charge help your model? Why/why not?\n",
    "2. Might more training data help?\n",

    "3. Perhaps we did not have enough model parameters to accurately represent the mapping. You can try to increase the number of nodes in the hidden layer and/or add mor hidden layers\n",
    "3.  Another hyperparameter to adjust is batch size, which is the number of training examples used to calculate the gradient on each step. While you may initially think that a higher batch size leads to faster or more accurate training, in practice this is not true. The \"noise\" that arises from using less training examples at each iteration can actually help find the global minimum of the loss function. (See here for more info: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.04836.pdf)\n",
    "4. Another hyperparameter to tune is the *learning rate*.\n",
    "\n",
    " - If the learning rate is too high, we are taking too large of a step in the gradient descent at each iteration and will miss narrow minima in the loss function.\n",
    " - If the learning rate is too small, then we are not traveling far enough in each iteration and we will take far too long to reach a minimum.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Perhaps the learning rate is too high and the network can't fine tune.\n",
    "5. If you see evidence of *overfitting*, meaning the validation loss begins to climb as the training loss decreases, you can try adding [dropout layers](https://docs.pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.Dropout.html) or [batch normalization](https://docs.pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.BatchNorm1d.html).\n",
